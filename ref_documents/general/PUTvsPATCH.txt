Difference Between PUT and PATCH HTTP methods?

🧩 1.) PUT - Replace the Entire Resource

Purpose: 

PUT is used to replace an entire resource with a new version.

Behavior:

-> The client sends the complete representation of the resource.

-> If the resource already exists, it is fully replaced.

-> If it doesn’t exist, the server can create it (depending on 
   implementation).

Example:

PUT /users/123
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "id": 123,
  "name": "Alice",
  "email": "alice@example.com"
}

🟢 After this request, the resource /users/123 will contain 
   exactly this JSON. If there was a previous field like "age": 30 that isn’t in the new body, it will be deleted.

🧩 2.) PATCH — Update Part of the Resource

Purpose:

PATCH is used to partially update a resource — you only send the fields that need to change.

Behavior:

-> The client sends only the data that should be updated.

-> Other fields remain unchanged.

-> More efficient for small updates.

Example:

PATCH /users/123
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "email": "alice@newdomain.com"
}

🟢 This will only update the email field of user 123 — the rest of the user’s data stays the same.
