Four main components of the REST API;

1.) Endpoint
2.) Headers
3.) Payload
4.) Status Code

What's an Endpoint?

An endpoint is the URL where an API listens for your request. Think of it like the API's home address

Example: https://api.example.com/users

What are Headers?

Headers are extra info you attach with your request. They tell the server how to handle it.

Common Headers:

1.) Content-Type: application/json
2.) Authorization: Bearer token123
3.) Accpet: application/json

What are Payload?

The payload is the actual data you send (in POST or PUT)

Example:

{
	"username": "testUser",
	"password": "securePass"
}

Status Codes

Status codes are the API's way of saying what happened. Like getting a reply "Received & done" or "Not found?"

Common Codes:

Success Codes (2xx):-
200 OK        : The request has succeeded.
201 Created   : A new resource has been created.
204 No Content: The server successfully processed the request, but there's no 
                content to send back.

Client Error Codes (4xx):-
400 Bad Request       : The server cannot process the request due to a client error.
401 Unauthorized      : The client lacks valid authentication credentials.
403 Forbidden         : The client has valid credentials but lacks permission to 
                        access the resource.
404 Not Found         : The requested resource could not be found.

                        resource.
409 Conflict          : The request could not be completed due to a conflict with 
                        the current state of the resource.

                           the server.

                           to maintenance or being overloaded.
