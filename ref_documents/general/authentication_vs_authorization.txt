Authentication vs Authorization

In Nutshell Authentication confirming "who you are?"

Is the process of verifying a user's identity, typically by checking credentials like a password or a fingerprint.

In Nutshell Authorization confirming "What you can do?"

Is the process of determining what actions or resources a verified user is permitted to access within a system.

Authentication serves as a prerequisite for authorization; a system must first know who a user is before it can decide what they are allowed to do.

Authentication

Purpose: To verify the identity of a user or entity. 

Questions answered: "Who are you?" 

Methods: Usernames and passwords, biometrics (fingerprints, retina scans), one-time codes, or certificates.

Example: A front desk clerk asking for your ID to verify your reservation is authentication. 

Authorization

Purpose:
To grant or deny permissions for a user to access specific resources or perform actions. 

Questions answered:
"What can you access?" or "What are you allowed to do?"

Methods:
Role-based access control (RBAC), attribute-based authorization, rule-based authorization, or context-based authorization.

Example:
The hotel key you receive after checking in is authorization, granting access to your room, the gym, or other amenities. 

How They Work Together

1. A user attempts to access a system. 
2. The system performs authentication to verify the user's identity using provided 
   credentials. 
3. Once authenticated, the system performs authorization to check if the 
   now-identified user has the necessary permissions to access the requested resource or perform the requested action. 
4. If both are successful, the user is granted access; otherwise, access is denied.
