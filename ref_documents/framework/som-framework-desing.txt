Why Framework is needed?

- Remove to repetitive code
- to improve automation script maintainability
- re-usability (our test base grows)

Selenium WebDriver (UI Automation)

- Page Object Model (POM)

- UI Page you have in your application you're going to create separate class for that
- element action converted into method

  enterUserName();
  enterPassword();
  clickLoginBtn();

Service Object Model (SOM) - API Automation

- Each and every service(endpoint) in your project you're going to create separate class
- HTTP action for the particular service should be converted into the method
- Each HTTP methods action based on the business logic
- Create the object or extend the service class to the cucumber step definition class

 |__ IncidentService (class)
          |
          |__ createIncident(String requestPayload); (methods) == post(String requestPayload);
          |__ createIncident(File requestPayload); 
          |__ createIncident(Object requestPayload); 
          |__ createIncident();
          |__ updateIncident(String requestPayload);
          |__ updateIncident(File requestPayload);
          |__ updateIncident(Object requestPayload);
          |__ updateIncident();
          |__ deleteIncident(String sysID);
          |__ getIncident();
          |__ getIncident(String sysID);


com.jira.endpoints
    |
    |__ IssueService
            |
            |__ createIssue();          


The idea behind SOM pattern is to encapsulate API requests and their associated business logic into set of reusable service object.

Service Object Modal act as an abstraction layer between test script and Restassured library.

Beneficiary of Service Object Model: Encapsulation, Reusability, Readability and Flexibility.
