For withBodyFile() method in wiremock java. Where we need to store json file?

When using the "withBodyFile" method in WireMock in a Java project, the JSON file (or any other response body file) should be stored in the following location by default:

src/test/resources/__files

Explanation:

src/test/resources:
This is the standard location in Maven and Gradle projects for test resources, including configuration files, data files, and, in this case, WireMock response body files.

__files:
This specific directory name (__files with two underscores) is a convention enforced by WireMock. It's the default directory where WireMock looks for response body files when using withBodyFile.

Example Usage:
If you have a JSON file named my-response.json containing your desired response body, you would place it in src/test/resources/__files/my-response.json. Then, in your WireMock stubbing code, you would reference it like this:

import static com.github.tomakehurst.wiremock.client.WireMock.*;

stubFor(get(urlEqualTo("/api/data"))
    .willReturn(aResponse()
        .withStatus(200)
        .withHeader("Content-Type", "application/json")
        .withBodyFile("my-response.json")));

Customizing the File Location:

While src/test/resources/__files is the default, you can configure WireMock to look for files in a different directory if needed. This is typically done when initializing the WireMockServer instance:

import com.github.tomakehurst.wiremock.WireMockServer;
import static com.github.tomakehurst.wiremock.core.WireMockConfiguration.wireMockConfig;

WireMockServer wireMockServer = new WireMockServer(wireMockConfig()
    .usingFilesUnderDirectory("src/test/resources/my_custom_files_location"));
