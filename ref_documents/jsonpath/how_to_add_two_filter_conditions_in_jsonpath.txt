how to add two filter conditions in jsonpath

To add multiple filter conditions in JSONPath, you can use logical operators within the filter expression. The most common logical operators are && for AND and || for OR.

Here's how to apply them:

$.items[?(@.property1 == 'value1' && @.property2 > 10)]

In this example:

-> $ refers to the root of the JSON document.
-> .items selects an array named "items".
-> [?()] indicates a filter expression applied to the elements of the "items" array.
-> @ refers to the current element being evaluated within the array.
-> @.property1 == 'value1' is the first condition, checking if property1 equals  
   'value1'.
-> && is the logical AND operator, requiring both conditions to be true.
-> @.property2 > 10 is the second condition, checking if property2 is greater than 
   10.

This expression will return all objects within the "items" array where property1 is 'value1' AND property2 is greater than 10.

You can also use || for an OR condition:

$.items[?(@.property1 == 'value1' || @.property3 == 'value3')]

This will return objects where property1 is 'value1' OR property3 is 'value3' (or both).

Parentheses can be used for grouping and controlling the order of evaluation, similar to mathematical expressions:

$.items[?((@.property1 == 'value1' && @.property2 > 10) || @.property3 == 'value3')]
