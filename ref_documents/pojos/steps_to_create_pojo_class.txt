Steps to Create a POJO Class in Java:

Creating a Plain Old Java Object (POJO) class in Java involves a few straightforward steps to ensure it adheres to the POJO principles of simplicity and data encapsulation.

Step 1) Define the Class Structure:

Create a public class with a meaningful name that reflects the data it will hold (e.g., Employee, Product, User).

    public class Employee {
        // Class members will be defined here
    }

Step 2) Declare Private Fields (Attributes):

Declare instance variables (fields) within the class to represent the data attributes. These fields should be declared as private to enforce encapsulation, meaning they can only be accessed or modified through methods defined within the class.

    public class Employee {
        private String firstName;
        private String lastName;
        private int age;
        private double salary;
    }

    public class Employee {
        private String firstName;
        private String lastName;
        private int age;
        private double salary;

        public Employee() {
            // Default constructor
        }
    }

Step 3) Implement Public Getter and Setter Methods:

For each private field, create public "getter" methods (e.g., getFirstName()) to retrieve the value of the field, and public "setter" methods (e.g., setFirstName(String firstName)) to modify its value. These methods provide controlled access to the encapsulated data.

    public class Employee {
        private String firstName;
        private String lastName;
        private int age;
        private double salary;

        public Employee() {}

        public String getFirstName() {
            return firstName;
        }

        public void setFirstName(String firstName) {
            this.firstName = firstName;
        }

        public String getLastName() {
            return lastName;
        }

        public void setLastName(String lastName) {
            this.lastName = lastName;
        }

        public int getAge() {
            return age;
        }

        public void setAge(int age) {
            this.age = age;
        }

        public double getSalary() {
            return salary;
        }

        public void setSalary(double salary) {
            this.salary = salary;
        }
    }
