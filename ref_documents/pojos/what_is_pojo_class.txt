what is pojo class in java?

A POJO (Plain Old Java Object) class in Java is a simple, standard Java class that represents a data structure. It's designed to hold data and typically includes methods to access and modify that data. The term "Plain Old Java Object" emphasizes that it's a basic Java object without special restrictions or dependencies on specific frameworks or APIs.

Key characteristics of a POJO class:

1) Encapsulation: It typically encapsulates its state using private fields to maintain data integrity.

2) Getters and Setters: It provides public getter methods to retrieve the values of its fields and public setter methods to modify those values. This follows the JavaBeans 
   convention, making it easily usable with many Java frameworks. 

3) Constructors: It usually includes one or more constructors to initialize its objects, including a default (no-argument) constructor.

4) No Special Dependencies: A POJO does not extend or implement any specific framework-related classes or interfaces (e.g., HttpServlet, EntityBean). It also avoids pre-specified 
   annotations that tie it to a particular framework.

5) Focus on Data: Its primary purpose is to represent data and associated behavior, making it a clear and reusable component for data transfer between different layers of an 
   application.

public class Product {
    private String name;
    private double price;
    private int quantity;

    // Default constructor
    public Product() {
    }

    // Parameterized constructor
    public Product(String name, double price, int quantity) {
        this.name = name;
        this.price = price;
        this.quantity = quantity;
    }

    // Getter methods
    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }

    public double getPrice() {
        return price;
    }

    public int getQuantity() {
        return quantity;
    }

    // Setter methods
    public void setName(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }

    public void setPrice(double price) {
        this.price = price;
    }

    public void setQuantity(int quantity) {
        this.quantity = quantity;
    }
}
