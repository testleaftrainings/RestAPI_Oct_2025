Retrying failed test scripts in Postman can be achieved by implementing a retry mechanism within your test scripts, typically using postman.setNextRequest() and environment variables. This allows you to re-execute a request if its tests fail, based on a defined number of retries.
Here's a general approach:
Initialize a retry counter: In the Pre-request Script of your request, initialize an environment variable (e.g., retryCount) to 0 or
This variable will track the number of retries for the current request.

    if (!pm.environment.get("retryCount")) {
        pm.environment.set("retryCount", 1);
    }

Implement retry logic in Tests: In the Tests tab of your request, after your assertions, check if the tests failed and if the retry count is below a maximum limit. If both conditions are met, increment the retryCount and use postman.setNextRequest() to re-run the same request.

    const maxRetries = 3; // Define your maximum number of retries

    // Example test (replace with your actual tests)
    pm.test("Status code is 200", function () {
        pm.response.to.have.status(200);
    });

    if (!pm.response.to.have.status(200) && parseInt(pm.environment.get("retryCount")) < maxRetries) {
        let currentRetryCount = parseInt(pm.environment.get("retryCount"));
        pm.environment.set("retryCount", currentRetryCount + 1);

        // Optional: Add a delay before retrying
        // setTimeout(function() {}, 2000); // 2-second delay

        postman.setNextRequest(pm.info.requestName); // Re-run the current request
    } else {
        // If tests pass or max retries reached, clear the retry counter
        pm.environment.unset("retryCount");
    }

Clear retry counter on success: Ensure that if the tests pass or the maximum number of retries is reached, the retryCount environment variable is reset or cleared to prevent it from affecting subsequent requests.

Important Considerations:
Infinite loops: Be careful with your retry conditions to avoid creating infinite loops if tests consistently fail. Define a clear maxRetries limit.
Dependencies: If your requests have dependencies, ensure that retrying a single request doesn't disrupt the flow or state for other requests in your collection.
Error handling: Consider how you want to handle failures after the maximum number of retries has been reached. You might want to log the failure or take other actions.
Collection Runner: This retry logic works well when running requests individually or within a collection using the Collection Runner.
