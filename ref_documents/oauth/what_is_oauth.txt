What is OAuth 2.0?

OAuth(Open Authorization) 2.0 is an authorization framework that allows a user to grant a third-party application limited access to their protected resources on another service, without sharing their credentials. 

In Nutshell, OAuth2.0 is a protocol for sharing user authorization across systems.

It works by issuing an access token to the application, which it uses to access specific data on the user's behalf. 

This is commonly seen when you "Login with Google" or "Login with Facebook" to grant an app access to your profile information or other data.  

An OAuth 2.0 flow has the following roles(Entities):-

--> Resource Owner: Entity who owns the protected data and has the ability 
    to grant access to it. Typically, this is the end-user (e.g., you, the user of a Google account).

--> Resource Server: Server hosting the protected resources. This is the 
    API you want to access.

--> Client: Application requesting access to a protected resource on behalf 
    of the Resource Owner.

--> Authorization Server: Server that authenticates the Resource Owner and 
    issues access tokens after getting proper authorization. In this case, GMail, Facebook or apple account etc...

How it works:-

1) User-to-Client Authorization: The user grants permission to an application (the client) to access their data on another service (the resource server). 

2) Client to Authorization Server: The application redirects the user to the service's authorization server, where the user logs in. 

3) Resource Owner Consent: The user is asked to consent to the application's request for access. 

4) Authorization Code: If the user grants consent, the authorization server sends an authorization code back to the client application. 

5) Token Exchange: The client application sends this code, along with its own credentials, to the authorization server to receive an access token. 

6) Accessing Resources: The client uses the access token to make requests to the resource server to access the user's data. 

7) Security: This process keeps the user's login credentials private, as the access token is temporary and grants limited access to specific resources. 

Key concepts:-

Authorization vs. Authentication: OAuth 2.0 is a protocol for authorization (granting access to resources), not authentication (verifying identity), although it is often used alongside authentication mechanisms.

Access Tokens: These are credentials that the client application uses to access protected resources. They can be short-lived and have defined scopes (e.g., read-only access). 

Grant Types: OAuth 2.0 defines different "flows" or grant types for obtaining an access token, depending on the type of application (e.g., web server, mobile app, single-page app). 

4 Types of OAuth Flows:-

1.) Authorization Code
2.) Client Credentials
3.) Implicit Code
4.) Resource owner Password
