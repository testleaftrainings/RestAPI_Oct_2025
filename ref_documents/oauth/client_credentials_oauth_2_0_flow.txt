The Client Credentials OAuth 2.0 flow

How it works:-

Step1:- Registration: The client application registers with an authorization server and receives a unique client ID and a client secret.

Step2:- Token Request: The application sends a request to the authorization server's token endpoint. This request includes its client ID and client secret for authentication, along with the grant_type set to "client_credentials".

Step3:- Token Issuance: If the credentials are valid, the authorization server responds with an access token.

Step4:- Resource Access: The client application can then use this access token to make API calls to a resource server, proving its own identity to access its resources.
